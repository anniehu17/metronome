        <p>Hi! If you're here, then you wanted to learn more about why you have to click a pop-up every time you open the metronome.</p>
        <p>In order to load our sound files (that nice wood block sound in our metronome), the user must first take an action.</p>
        <p>This is to prevent malicious websites from bombarding their users with sounds as soon as they open their website, even before the user has interacted with it.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, in order to accomodate this security feature, we had to create a pop-up to ensure the user interacted with our site before our metronome could play sounds.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, if your first action on our site was to click "Play", you may not hear anything because the sound has to finish loading first.</p>
        <p>I hope that explanation helps and thank you for your patience.</p>
